### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About me:
My name is Trish Milletich, and I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Maryland Baltimore. My research currently focuses on the immunological responses of vaccines, while my previous doctoral research focused on studying the relationship between the infant gut microbiome and the future onset of autoimmune and gastrointestinal diseases. Here I've posted the R-code associated with my publications, which you can access from the code's ReadMe file. 

I also received two bachelor's degrees in both statistics and bioinformatics from Virginia Commonwealth University. 

I am passionate about scientific communication and am always striving to learn the best method to graph and explain results so that everyone can understand our scientific discoveries!
